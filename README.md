Uncovering the complete picture of UK road accident patterns. 🚗⚠️

My comprehensive analysis of UK traffic data reveals multifaceted insights across time, location, environment, and vehicle type. Key evidence-based findings:
🕔 Time: A significant peak during the evening commute (4-6 PM).
🛣️ Infrastructure: Single carriageways and roundabouts are high-risk areas.
🌤️ Weather: Most accidents occur in clear, dry conditions, pointing to behavioral factors over environmental ones.
🚑 Severity: While most accidents are 'Slight', the conditions for 'Serious' outcomes require targeted intervention.
🏙️ Area: Urban areas have higher frequency; rural areas see more severe outcomes.
🚙 Vehicles: Cars are most frequently involved, but analysis of goods vehicles, vans, and motorcycles provides crucial context for policy and safety campaigns.
